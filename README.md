# Extreme Weather App

## Installation
1. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
2. If page (weather data) doesn't show up, this means the trial for WeatherAPI has run out. To fix this simply create a WeatherAPI account and change the `API_KEY` in `./services/weatherService.js` to new key

## Usage

1. Run the app using `npm start`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Using the **[WeatherAPI](www.weatherapi.com)** instead of [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), because OpenWeather requires bank details to give extended features.
